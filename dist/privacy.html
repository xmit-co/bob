            The app doesn't collect any data and doesn't connect anywhere not
            made obvious through the interface, other than to download
            dependencies. We don't collect anything. The services we reach
            probably do.
        </p>
        <p>To that effect, here are the known locations being reached:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>github.com to download (cached) dependencies;</li>
            <li>The npm registry, as part of bun operations.</li>
